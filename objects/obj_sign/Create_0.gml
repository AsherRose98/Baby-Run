/*
Okay, so I've tried everything - literally EVERTHING to get people
to realize that this is QUICK SAND - you CAN'T WALK ON IT.  I made
it bubble, I made it move, I even put up a sign!!  What more do you
people want???  READ.  IT'S NOT HARD!!

Developing games is easy - getting people to follow or even READ 
instructions;

Now that's hard.
