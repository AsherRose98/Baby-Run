/*
I know I shouldn't be complaining, since, you know, I'm the one that 
built the game - but why is this the only object that is the correct
size relative to the baby?  Like, the baby is about as big as a moped 
but still small enoughto ride in the back of a toy truck.

Like, I was thinking of this the entire time I was building the game, yet
not a single person who has seen it questioned this.  Is it just something
we're all so used to that we don't even think about it anymore?  Like how
when we reach the end of a sentance our eyes just know to go on to the next
